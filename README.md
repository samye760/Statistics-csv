## Statistics-csv

This program utilizes Python's csv module to compute numerous statistics. It has some predefined functions for baseball in particular. I have added some sample .csv files relating to baseball statistics to see how the code can be run, as well as sample functions to play around with it.

# Use

Please pay attention to the format of the sample .csv files added. The code will be able to handle files in a similar format, but anything drastically different may break it. It's safest to play around with the files already tested, and get your own statistics from there.
